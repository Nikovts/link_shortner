Challenge
Link Shortner
is to create a link shortner with Laravel and Vue.js. Any visitor can input a web
link which will then be shortned by the application and that shortned link will be returned to
the visitor.
For example, if the visitor shortens https://developers.google.com/ the application may
redirect any visitor from http://myapp.com/dqpl4 to https://developers.google.com/
Any visits to the shortened link will be redirected to the initial/input web link.
